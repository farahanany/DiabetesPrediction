# DiabetesPrediction
This study explores the application of machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. We compare the performance of various models, including artificial neural networks (ANN), k-means clustering, Naive Bayes, and decision trees. The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning in medical diagnostics and highlight the importance of data quality and feature selection.
